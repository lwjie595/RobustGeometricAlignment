# Robust_geometric_alignment
A Data-dependent Approach for High Dimensional (Robust) Wasserstein Alignment

There are 6 main .m files which contain domain adaption, nature langurage and PPI.

DA_caltech.m is the code for the fractional Wasserstein distance for domain adaption.

DA_caltech_mulprocess.m  is the code for the Wasserstein distance for domain adaption.

BiL_net.m is code for fractional Wasserstein distance  for nature langurage.

BiL.m  is the code for the Wasserstein distance for nature langurage.

tp2.m is the code for fractional Wasserstein distance  for PPI.

tp.m is the code for the Wasserstein distance for PPI.
